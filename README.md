This repository contains the assets used to test, build, and deploy the [aaslp.lib.unb.ca](https://aaslp.lib.unb.ca) Drupal application. This repository extends the [unb-libraries/docker-drupal](https://github.com/unb-libraries/docker-drupal) base image, which deploys nginx and php-fpm in the service container.

## Deploy this Application Yourself
Local deployment, development and testing of aaslp.lib.unb.ca is simple! [dockworker](https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker) provides web application developers, site builders and operational engineers a single technical entrypoint with a consistent, unified workflow regardless of the framework.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Dockworker requires a minimal number of 'one time' dependencies. Some of these may already be installed in your local development environment; see the list of these dependencies (with installation instructions) [here](https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker/blob/5.x/docs/prerequisites.md).

### Step 2: Deploy Locally
With all dependencies installed, you are ready to deploy this application locally:

```
composer install
vendor/bin/dockworker deploy
```

And that's it! The application will build and deploy in your local environment.

### (Optional) Step 3: Create a Dockworker Shell Alias
If you work with dockworker applications often, you may also consider [creating a dockworker alias in your shell](https://github.com/unb-libraries/dockworker/blob/5.x/docs/alias.md).

## Other useful commands
Run ```vendor/bin/dockworker``` to list available dockworker commands for this application.
